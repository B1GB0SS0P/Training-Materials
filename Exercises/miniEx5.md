# Mini Exercise 5

    1. Write a recursive function that accepts two arguments, x and y and returns the value of x times y. (calculation should be done as 4+4+4+4+4+4+4)
    Sample Input: 7, 4
    Output: 28
<hr>

    2. Write a recursive function that accepts an integer argument, n. The function should display n lines of asterisks on the screen, with the first line showing 1 asterisk, the second line showing 2 asterisks, up to the nth line which shows n asterisks.
    Sample Input: 5
    Output:
    *
    **
    ***
    ****
    *****
<hr>

    3. Write a recursive function that takes in an integer and returns the sum of all the integers from 1 up to the number passed as an argument.
    Sample Input: 50
    Output: 1275
<hr>

    4. Write a recursive function that takes in a list of integers and returns the maximum value of the list. (no using 'max' function)
    Sample Input: [2, 435 , 234, 1, 4, 657, 3, 23, 98, 60]
    Output: 657
<hr>

    5. Write a recursive function that takes in a string and returns a True if it is a palindrome (spelled the same from front and back) and False if it is not one.
    Sample Input: 'rotator'
    Output: True
<hr>

    6. Given an array words containing strings, find all possible permutations of concatenated strings containing all strings in words, and return a list of the concatenated strings. (Hint: Use recursion)
    Sample Input: ['apple', 'pen', 'pineapple']
    Output: ['applepenpineapple', 'applepineapplepen', 'penapplepineapple', 'penpineappleapple', 'pineappleapplepen', 'pineapplepenapple']
