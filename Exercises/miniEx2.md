# Mini Exercise 2

    Objective(s): Tests for simple code implementation and designing of Data Structures.
    If the questions are too easy, try writing each of the solutions out in one line!

    Q1: Copy the dictionary student_grades below into your Python file. student_grades contains student names as keys and lists of their grades as values.
    student_grades = {
        'Gerard': [85, 90, 92],
        'Andre': [88, 85, 84, 90],
        'Gavin': [90, 92, 94, 88, 87],
        'Zen': [100, 100, 100, 69]
    }

    Write a program that calculates the average grade for each student and prints a new dictionary where its keys are the student names and its values are their corresponding average grades.
    
    Output:
    {'Gerard': 89.0, 'Andre': 86.75, 'Gavin': 90.2, 'Zen': 92.25}

    Q2: Given a tuple called student_info containing information about a student, where the tuple includes the student's name, age, grade level and best subject, write a Python program to print each element of the tuple in a formatted way, indicating what information each element represents.
    Usage of F-strings is strongly encouraged.

    Test Case:
    student_info = ('Zheng Long', 19, 'Secondary 1', 'Math')

    Output:
    Name: Zheng Long
    Age: 19
    Grade Level: Secondary 1
    Best Subject: Math

    It is possible to code out both questions above in 1 line (excluding the initialisation of student_grades/student_info)!

    Q3: Write a program that takes a dictionary as an input and swaps the keys and values of the dictionary.

    Input: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
    Output: Here is your new dictionary: {1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c'}
